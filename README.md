<h1>Real-Time Age and Gender Detection</h1>
This project implements real-time age and gender detection using OpenCV's DNN module and pre-trained deep learning models. It processes video streams from a webcam, detects faces, and predicts the age and gender of individuals using pre-trained models. The results are displayed on the video feed in real-time.

<h1>Features</h1>
<h2>Face Detection:</h2>

Utilizes a pre-trained OpenCV face detector to identify faces in video frames.
<h2>Age and Gender Prediction:</h2>

Predicts the age group and gender of detected faces using pre-trained deep learning models.
<h2>Real-Time Visualization:</h2>

Draws bounding boxes around detected faces.
Displays the predicted age and gender on the video feed.

<h1>How It Works</h1>
<h2>1. Face Detection</h2>
The script uses OpenCV's Deep Neural Network (DNN) module for face detection.
A pre-trained model (opencv_face_detector_uint8.pb) detects faces in the video feed.
<br>
<h2>2. Age and Gender Prediction</h2>
Gender Detection:
Uses a pre-trained Caffe model (gender_net.caffemodel) to predict the gender (Male/Female).
Age Detection:
<br>
Uses a pre-trained Caffe model (age_net.caffemodel) to classify age into 8 groups:
(0-2), (4-6), (8-12), (15-20), (25-32), (38-43), (48-53), (60-100).
Predictions are made by passing detected face regions to the respective models.

<h2>3. Real-Time Display</h2>
#Bounding boxes are drawn around detected faces.
#Age and gender predictions are displayed as text annotations on the video feed.
